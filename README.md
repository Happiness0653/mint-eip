# Mint EIP: Decentralized Identity Protocol

A blockchain-native identity verification and reputation system leveraging EIP standards for secure, trustless user management.

## Overview

Mint EIP provides a robust, decentralized framework for identity verification and reputation tracking on blockchain networks. By implementing a flexible identity protocol, the system enables secure, transparent user interactions across decentralized platforms.

## Core Features

- Decentralized identity creation and management
- Flexible reputation scoring mechanism
- Trustless verification through authorized attestors
- Multi-tier reputation system
- Secure identity profile updates
- Privacy-preserving design

## Smart Contract: EIP Identity

### Key Functions

- `create-identity`: Establish a new decentralized identity
- `update-identity`: Modify existing identity details
- `add-attestor`: Register identity verification authorities
- `get-identity`: Retrieve comprehensive identity information
- `get-identity-tier`: Determine user's reputation level

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks wallet
- Basic understanding of decentralized identity concepts
- STX for transaction fees

### Example Usage

#### Creating an Identity

```clarity
(contract-call? .eip-identity create-identity
    u"my-handle"
    u"Personal identity description")
```

#### Updating Identity Profile

```clarity
(contract-call? .eip-identity update-identity
    u"updated-handle"
    u"Refined identity description")
```

## Security Considerations

- Owner-controlled attestor management
- Input validation for identity creation
- Prevents duplicate identity registrations
- Reputation tracking with tier-based system
